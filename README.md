## storycompile.sh ##
## README ##

This shell script takes a list of text files and copies their contents into a new file. It was created by xandernaut for use during NaNoWriMo, for the purpose of easily counting total words over several text files.

It was inspired in part by Thomas Gideon's "flashbake" scripts.


### Usage ###
Basic usage:

  ./storycompile.sh /path/to/project/

storycompile requires a file called .storycompile to reside in the project directory, containing the relative paths of the files to be compiled.


### Installation ###
storycompile doesn't require special installation instructions, but it can be added to a local applications directory.
